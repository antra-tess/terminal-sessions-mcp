# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Fixed

- **Command completion is now detected at actual completion** 🏁 - The
  exit-code marker is chained onto the same shell line as the command
  (`. '<tempfile>'; echo "<<<EXIT:<nonce>:$?>>>"`) instead of being typed
  into the PTY 50ms later. This fixes the whole family of "doesn't notice
  the command ended / waits for the full timeout" bugs:
  - `runCommand("exit")` (or any command that kills the shell) resolved only
    at the fallback timeout; the PTY exit handler now resolves the in-flight
    command immediately with the shell's exit code, and queued commands fail
    fast instead of hanging.
  - Commands that read stdin (`read`, REPLs, `ssh`...) used to swallow the
    delayed marker line as *input* — burning the full timeout AND feeding a
    line of garbage into whatever was reading (picture a password prompt).
    Nothing extra is typed into the PTY anymore.
  - A command (or its output) merely *containing* marker-shaped text like
    `<<<EXIT:7>>>` resolved instantly with that bogus exit code, before the
    command even ran. Markers now carry a per-command nonce, and the marker
    string is split in the echoed command text so no echo of the typed line
    can ever match.
  - After a timeout, the stale marker from the still-running command could
    resolve the *next* command with the wrong exit code and mangled output.
    Nonces make stale markers inert (and they're stripped from output).
- **All commands go through the temp-file path** (not just multi-line ones),
  which also fixes single-line commands longer than the tty's canonical-mode
  line buffer (1024 bytes on macOS) being silently truncated, and translates
  the temp-file path to `/mnt/<drive>/...` form so sourcing works under WSL
  on Windows.
- Exec plumbing (wrapper echoes, markers) is filtered out of session logs,
  so `tailLogs` shows `$ command` + output without internal noise.

### Changed

- **A timed-out command is left untouched.** Previously the marker machinery
  incidentally poked blocked stdin-readers with garbage input. Now a command
  that times out (exitCode -1) simply keeps running in the session — check on
  it with `tailLogs`, unblock it with `sendInput`, or stop it with
  `sendSignal`. The `runCommand` tool description documents this.
- Command bodies are sourced with `.` (POSIX) instead of the `source`
  bashism, so plain sh/dash sessions work too.

## v1.6.0 - 2026-07-11

### Added

- **Named keys for `sendInput`** ⌨️ - New `keys` parameter, tmux `send-keys`
  style, so agents can drive TUIs (codex, vim, htop, ...): `Enter`, `Tab`,
  `Shift-Tab`, `Esc`, `Space`, `Backspace`, `Delete`, arrows, `Home`/`End`,
  `PageUp`/`PageDown`, `F1`-`F12`, `C-a`..`C-z` (Ctrl), `M-<char>` (Alt/Meta).
  Raw control characters cannot pass through the MCP JSON tool layer, so named
  keys are the supported way to send them. Unknown key names return an error
  listing the valid vocabulary.
- Unit tests for key decoding and input assembly (`npm test`, zero-dependency
  `node --test`).

### Changed

- **`appendNewline` now appends `\r` (CR) instead of `\n` (LF)** - CR is what
  a real Enter key sends; canonical-mode shells are unaffected (`icrnl` maps
  CR to NL) and raw-mode TUIs now actually submit. If you were relying on a
  literal trailing LF byte reaching a raw-mode program, pass
  `appendNewline: false` and include `\n` in `input` yourself.
- `appendNewline` defaults to **false** when `keys` is provided (the caller
  controls the exact bytes); pass `true` explicitly to add Enter after keys.
- `sendInput` failures now include the error message instead of a bare
  `success: false`.

### Notes

- Already-running MCP bridge processes must be restarted to expose the new
  `keys` parameter - an old bridge silently drops it (and reports success).

### Migration from connectome-ts

Files moved from `connectome-ts/src/testing/`:
- `session-server-v3.ts` → `src/server/session-server-v3.ts`
- `websocket-api.ts` → `src/server/websocket-api.ts`
- `start-session-server.ts` → `src/server/start-session-server.ts`
- `mcp-server.ts` → `src/mcp/mcp-server.ts`
- `mcp-stdio-server.ts` → `src/mcp/mcp-stdio-server.ts`
- `websocket-client.ts` → `src/client/websocket-client.ts`
- `session-cli.ts` → `cli/session-cli.ts`

All import paths updated to reflect new structure.
